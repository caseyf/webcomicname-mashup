# how?

1. I snarfed the comics from webcomicname.com by using a $3 "Tumblelog Picture Downloader" app from the Mac App Store. There are several Tumblr picture download projects on Github if you'd rather try those.
2. Split the panels into 3 images with <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kpublicmail/comicstrip/devel/view/head:/comicstrip">comicstrip</a>.  The <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~kpublicmail">original author</a> of this did all of the hard work üëè `comicstrip` did a pretty great job and got all 3 panels from most of them. This shell script processes each one and names them with consecutive numbers. It could be improved by having it reuse a strip number if the correct number of panels are not found. That way there aren't gaps.

    ```
    ls -1 tumblr-downloader-images/*.jpg | nl | while read line; do
      parts=($line)
      index=${parts[0]}
      filename=${parts[1]}
      eval "./comicstrip -f $filename --min-width=160 --min-height=160 --prefix=strip_${index}_"
    done
    ```
    
    **NOTE:** The `comicstrip` script is from 2009 and it still runs fine  with Python 2.7 but it needs some minor changes to work with Pillow. Here are <a href="https://github.com/caseyf/webcomicname-mashup/commit/c1712cb9f282503beaedf2ad3be7bcaefbe441e9">my changes</a>.
  
  3. Now the filenames are all like `strip_[STRIP NUMBER]_[PANEL NUMBER].jpg` so  we can use Javascript to come up with 3 random panel image links and insert them into a page.   I dumped all of the images into Amazon S3 because it was easy. There is <a href="https://support.glitch.com/t/easier-way-to-reference-assets/394">probably a way</a> to store them in Glitch and still get predictable URLs.

4. The source for the rest is all here :) The <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/minimalist-webcomicname-mashup">minimal version</a> picks 3 random numbers between 1 and the # of panels, uses that to create the URL, and adds an IMG to the page for each one.  The main difference between this version and the minimal version is that this version adds unique URLs for each mashup  and back button support so that you can more easily share, etc.

# oddities

The panels were automatically cropped and I didn't try to do anything more with the results. The borders don't always line up and the titles (or pieces of the titles in the 2nd panel, when the titles are long) still appear.

There is some unnecessary flashing going on when loading the page the first time a after hitting "make me a new comic" (that link just loads the page again).

There are a couple weird/messed up panels that I haven't excluded.

All in all there are 708 panels.


**üåÖ the next morning:**

I messed around with extracting the titles. There is a variable in the page, `randomTitlesToo`, that you can use to turn the title swapping on and off. 

My hacky Ruby code for splitting out the titles is here: <a href="https://github.com/caseyf/webcomicname-mashup/blob/master/scripts/ohno_title_splitter.rb">ohno_title_splitter.rb</a>. It looks for consecutive horizontal lines that are more black lines than not. It isn't smart about the wiggly borders so it only did an okay job. Sometimes the title for a panel wasn't correctly removed so 2 titles (the random title and the panel title) are stacked on top of each other in a funny way. Other times, it is cropped in the wrong place.

Maybe looking at rows of pixels and splitting once we come to the 2nd completely white gutter (first is before the title, 2nd is after) would have worked better but oh well!

I used `dom-to-image` to add a save button. It only supports Chrome and Firefox.

## ‚Üê the source file, index.html

I crammed the HTML, CSS and Javascript into one page.
