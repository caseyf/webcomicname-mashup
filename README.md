A thing that makes Webcomicname mash-up comics!

I saved a copy of the very first, <strong>minimal version</strong> in case you want to start there:

# how?

1. I snarfed the comics from webcomicname.com by using a $3 Tumblr Downloader app from the Mac App Store
2. Split the panels into 3 images with this Python code: <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kpublicmail/comicstrip/devel/view/head:/comicstrip">comicstrip</a>.  The <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~kpublicmail">original author</a> of this did all of the hard work üëè `comicstrip` did a pretty great job and got all 3 panels from most of them. This shell script processes each one and names them with consecutive numbers. It could be improved by having it reuse a strip number if the correct number of panels are not found. That way there aren't gaps.

    ```
    ls -1 tumblr-downloader-images/*.jpg | nl | while read line; do
      parts=($line)
      index=${parts[0]}
      filename=${parts[1]}
      eval "./comicstrip -f $filename --min-width=160 --min-height=160 --prefix=strip_${index}_"
    done
    ```
  
3. Now the filenames are all like `strip_[STRIP NUMBER]_[PANEL NUMBER].jpg` so  we can use Javascript to come up with 3 random panel image links and insert them into a page.   I dumped all of the images into Amazon S3 because I already have an account there. Storing them in Glitch won't work because the URLs wouldn't be predictable.

4. The source for the rest is all here :) The <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/minimalist-webcomicname-mashup">minimal version</a> picks 3 random numbers between 1 and the # of panels, uses that to create the URL, and adds an image for each one.


## ‚Üê the source file, index.html

I crammed the HTML, CSS and Javascript into one page because Glitch has a request limit (makes sense, since this is all free!) and I hoped that it would help with "529 too many requests" when I first tweeted about this :/
